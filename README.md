# React for geniuses

A guide for people who already know programming, but don't know the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Clone this repository

GitHub has a feature specifically for template repositories. It will squash master, create your repository and leave a permanent mark on your repository linking back to this one.

You can do the following to emulate the template feature without the mark:

```bash
git init
git checkout -b template
git pull https://github.com/rijx/react-for-geniuses.git
git checkout --orphan master
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Install its dependencies

You need to install your (newest) dependencies every time the package.json changes. It will generate a lock file which guarantees that your CI, your colleagues and your Docker container are all using the same versions.

Run this command to install your dependencies:

```
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

**Why not use npm?** npm has not had the best track record in terms of performance. I recommend using yarn to save yourself some headache later. Feel free to use `npm install` instead, but then you'll have to `package-lock.json` and possibly change some configs.

## Have fun

```
yarn run dev
```

## Production build

```
yarn run build
```

## Setting up your IDE

### Visual Studio Code

This command installs the helper plugins for ESLint, Prettier and Mocha:

```
yarn # installs ESLint, Prettier and Mocha locally
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode --install-extension maty.vscode-mocha-sidebar
```

The Mocha VSCode plugin doesn't seem to rerun tests when saving the test file. We're looking into it.

## Vocabulary

- React: virtual DOM rendering library
- Mocha: test runner
- Enzyme: React testing library
- Babel: compiles modern JS to ES5 for older browsers
- JSX: XML like syntax for calling React.createElement
- (S)CSS: mark up rules for HTML elements
- Webpack: bundles all code into one file
- ESLint: staticly analyze your code for possible errors
- Prettier: formats all code to one standard
